How many times have you or a friend claimed to have limited or no imagination? For everyone that thinks that is the case, I offer that you are sorely mistaken. Our lives are awash in imaginary constructs. They are not only pervasive, powerful, and immersive but also collective. Let's consider some examples.
  
Does the United States, Australia, or South Africa exist in reality? Nope. Pretend for a moment that you are an alien visitor to Earth. You are approaching our pale blue dot and you see the picture below emerging.
  
Do you see nations? Of course not. You see continents surrounded by oceans. It is Earth as it exists in physical reality. You would not recognize any nations until you engaged with the indigenous life, in other words us. Now consider this picture.
