  How many times have you or a friend claimed to have limited or no imagination?
  For everyone that thinks that is the case, I offer that you are sorely
  mistaken. Our lives are awash in imaginary constructs. They are not only
  pervasive, powerful, and immersive but also collective. Letâ€™s consider some
  examples.  Does the United States, Australia, or South Africa exist in
  reality? Nope. Pretend for a moment that you are an alien visitor to Earth.
  You are approaching our pale blue dot and you see the picture below emerging. 
  Do you see nations? Of course not. You see continents surrounded by oceans. It
  is Earth as it exists in physical reality. You would not recognize any nations
  until you engaged with the indigenous life, in other words us. Now consider
  this picture.
